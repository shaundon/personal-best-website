## What is Personal Best?

Personal Best is a workout insights app for iPhone. It reads your workouts from Apple Health and turns them into insights, leaderboards, fun facts, and more.

Personal Best doesn't record workouts itself, it leaves that to apps better specialised for it – like Strava, Peloton and Apple Fitness.

### Key features

* Loads of insights, from basic things like _calories burned last month_ to more specific ones like _coldest-ever workout_
* See leaderboards of your best workouts, and create your own custom leaderboards to rank your workouts however you want
* See photos taken during your workouts
* Plenty of widgets
* Siri and Shortcuts support
* App Clip support
* Turn your workouts into nice-looking custom images to share on social media
* Privacy first – workouts stay on your iPhone and I don't sell your data. No account or signup is required either
* Inexpensive subscription to unlock Personal Best Pro

## What's the story behind it?

I’m [Shaun](https://mstdn.social/@shaundon), an indie iOS developer in London, UK. In April 2020 during the UK's lockdown I decided to learn SwiftUI so I’d have something to in the evenings other than rewatch Friends for the sixteenth time. A week later, Personal Best was live on the App Store!

Since then, I’ve kept at it, and now Personal Best has thousands of active users and a high App Store rating. Little by little, Personal Best is becoming a best-in-class app that can stand with the greats on iOS.
